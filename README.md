# iris-flower-supervisedlearning
# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A supervised machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their physical measurements.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates supervised learning using the classic Iris dataset. It trains and compares three different classification algorithms, evaluates their performance, and generates comprehensive visualizations.

**Learning Type:** Supervised Learning (Multi-class Classification)

## 🎯 Objective

Predict the species of an iris flower based on four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) (included in scikit-learn)

**Details:**
- 150 samples
- 4 features
- 3 classes (50 samples each)
- No missing values

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy` - Numerical computing
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` - Visualization
  - `seaborn` - Statistical visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning algorithms

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 💻 Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Generate visualizations
3. Train three models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
4. Evaluate and compare model performance
5. Save results and visualizations

## 📈 Models Trained

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble learning method
   - Uses 100 decision trees

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - RBF kernel
   - Effective for non-linear classification

3. **Logistic Regression**
   - Linear classification model
   - Fast and interpretable

## 📊 Results

The project generates several outputs:

### Visualizations
- `iris_pairplot.png` - Feature relationships by species
- `correlation_heatmap.png` - Feature correlations
- `feature_boxplots.png` - Feature distributions by species
- `confusion_matrix.png` - Best model's confusion matrix
- `model_comparison.png` - Accuracy comparison

### Performance
Typical accuracy scores (may vary with random state):
- Random Forest: ~96-100%
- SVM: ~96-100%
- Logistic Regression: ~93-100%

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Petal measurements (length and width) are the most discriminative features
- Setosa species is linearly separable from the other two
- All three models achieve excellent accuracy (>95%) on this dataset
- Random Forest typically performs best due to its ensemble nature

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Data exploration and visualization techniques
